# PAPLCode

React app with a Java backend

## THIS CODE WILL NOT RUN

The Front-end is a Create React App that does not have all the project files but has the build and the src files I have edited.

The back-end needs a Intellij Ultimate (Web project) and a Tomcat server to be ran. (all source files in PAPLCode\JavaBack-end\DecisionMapServlet\src\main\java)
